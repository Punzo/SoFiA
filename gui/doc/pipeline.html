    <h1>Running the Pipeline</h1>
    
    <h2>From the User Interface</h2>
    
    <p>
      Once an input data cube has been selected and the desired parameter settings have been chosen, the pipeline can be launched from within the user interface, either by selecting <strong>Pipeline &rarr; Run Pipeline</strong> from the menu or by clicking on the corresponding tool bar button. The pipeline run can be aborted at any time by selecting <strong>Pipeline &rarr; Abort Pipeline</strong> from the menu or by clicking on the respective tool bar button.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      SoFiA will automatically save the current parameter settings to a temporary session file in the current working directory (named <code>SoFiA.session</code>) and then pass that file on to the actual pipeline. Note that by default this session file will be kept and automatically loaded again when exiting and restarting the SoFiA user interface from within the same working directory, so users can continue to work from where they previously stopped. Nonetheless, it is strongly advisable to explicitly save the final set of parameter settings to a permanent file for later use, as the session file is only temporary and will regularly get overwritten. In addition, it is possible to disable automatic session file keeping in the user settings, in which case any existing session file will automatically be deleted when exiting from SoFiA.
    </p>
    
    <h2>From the Terminal</h2>
    
    <p>
      Alternatively, the pipeline can be launched from the terminal after the parameter settings have been saved to an output file. To achieve this, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the output parameter file was saved. Then run the pipeline by typing
    </p>
    
    <p><code>sofia_pipeline.py &lt;parameter_file&gt;</code></p>
    
    where <code>&lt;parameter_file&gt;</code> is the name of the SoFiA parameter file. There is no difference between running the pipeline from the user interface or from the terminal, but the latter is more useful in situations where the pipeline needs to be launched by another application or shell script, e.g. to automatically process a larger number of data cubes.
